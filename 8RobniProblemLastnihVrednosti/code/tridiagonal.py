"""Routines to solve a tridiagonal matrix equation Ax=b where A is
tridiagonal with main diagonal d, subdiagonal a, and superdiagonal c.

                     tridiagonal matrix A.  a is the subdiagonal with a[0]

                     d[0] being the A[0,0] value and c is the superdiagonal
                     with c[0] being the A[0,1] value.

    OUTPUT:
        a, d, c    - arrays containing the data for the factored matrix

    NOTE:
        For this to be sure to work A should be strictly diagonally
        dominant, meaning that |d(i)| > |a(i-1)| + |c(i)| for each i.
        This ensures that pivoting will not be necessary.
